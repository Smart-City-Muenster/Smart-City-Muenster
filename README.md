- 👋 Hi, I’m @Smart-City-Muenster, an official unit from the city administration of [Münster (Westf.), Germany](https://www.stadt-muenster.de/) (in German: Stabsstelle Smart City der Stadt Münster). From 2022-2027, the Smart City Münster amongst ([several other German Smart Cities](https://www.smart-city-dialog.de/modellprojekte)) is a model project partially funded by the [Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and Building](https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/bauen-wohnen/bauen-wohnen-node.html).
- 👀 I’m interested in open-source-technologies that improve urban development and planning, citizen participation, city administration, and life in general in Münster.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop, distribute, and maintain open-source-software as an official administration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that makes Münster smart.
- 📫 Feel free to contact us (in German or English) with project ideas via github or [have a look at our website for more contact options](https://smartcity.ms/akteure/#team) (this github account is controlled by Thomas T.).
